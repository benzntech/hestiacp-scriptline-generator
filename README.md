HestiaCP is a fork of VestaCP, a bold and smart open smart initiative to offer a lightweight replacement to webserver commercial admin panels

 My humble contribution to this project is a tiny online app aimed to generate the necessary scriptline for an unatended HestiaCP installation



Tips for Using Hestia With Cloudflare
Cloudflare doesnâ€™t allow port 8083, so you can change Hestia to use 2083 instead in your terminal:

sudo su -

v-change-sys-port 2083
Make sure you have all the ports allowed in the Oracle ingress rules:

2083,80,443,143,993,110,995,25,465,587

Itâ€™s good to use Cloudflare origin SSL for maximum performance, you also get 15 year certificates and donâ€™t need to worry about updating certificates for while ðŸ™‚

To do this, you can add the Cloudflare certificate authority to your server like this:

sudo su -

wget https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/static/origin_ca_rsa_root.pem

mv origin_ca_rsa_root.pem origin_ca_rsa_root.crt

cp origin_ca_rsa_root.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates

update-ca-certificates
Cloudflare Email Tips:
For the A records for mail and webmail DNS, change them to DNS only:

Then use â€˜lets encryptâ€™ for SSL on your mail domain rather than Cloudflare:
